# Structure Your Time with Planning Templates for the Day, Week, Month, Sprint...
After finding a great daily planning template from Christopher at [vitaminp.info](https://vitaminp.info/mein-kreativer-tagesplaner-fuer-einen-produktiven-tag/), and later a decent weekly tear-off planner from Aldi, I decided to try my own hand at something to organize the whole month.

## Where's the Benefit
Though I do think the formatting of a template plays a central role in how useful it is, for me the main benefit in using templates to fill out again and again, is that I get into a routine of thinking about certain things. And when you fill out planning templates for a day, week or month, you get into the habit of going through a mental checklist at regular intervals.
