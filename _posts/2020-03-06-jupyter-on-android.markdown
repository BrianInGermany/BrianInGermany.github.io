# View and Edit Jupyter files on Android

#### Why run a Jupyter notebook on your phone?
That's a very good question. Maybe you're in a hurry, maybe you want to have a quick look at some files without taking out your laptop. Or maybe you're just bored in the bus on your way to work... 

#### Solution
With the [Termux](https://termux.com/) app for Android you can install Python, [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and a wide variety of Python packages from a Linux command line.

- Start off by installing Python with `pkg install python` to get Python 3.
- Then install Jupyter with `pip install jupyter`

The terminal will display a url on `localhost` with a port number and a key at the end of it. Copy this url into your browser, and voil√°, Jupyter notebook!
