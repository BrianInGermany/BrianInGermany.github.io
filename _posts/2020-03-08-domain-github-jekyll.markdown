# Why use Github and Jekyll?

- Jekyl lets you build a website fast from pre-made templates, extensible with your own code
- And Github hosts your website and generates you a free SSL certificate for https encryption
- Super easy to connect with your own domain name

*The Jekyll logo was downloaded from the [Jekyll GitHub repository](https://github.com/jekyll/brand)*
