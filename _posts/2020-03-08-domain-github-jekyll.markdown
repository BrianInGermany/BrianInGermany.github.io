# Why use Github and Jekyll?

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) lets you build a website fast from pre-made templates, extensible with your own code
  - Use built-in templates, or override them with your own changes file by file
- And [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/) hosts your website and generates you a free SSL certificate for https encryption
- Super easy to connect with your own domain name

*The Jekyll logo was downloaded from the [Jekyll GitHub repository](https://github.com/jekyll/brand)*
