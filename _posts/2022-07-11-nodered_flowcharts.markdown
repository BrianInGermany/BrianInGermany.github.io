## CAI on Nodered?
There are several packages for [Nodered](https://nodered.org/) out there for building bots with CAI products, such as IBM Watson, Amazon Lex or the Telegram chatbot interface.

But why is no one using Nodered for Conversational AI *design*? 
Its rich visual UI and powerful low-code features allow for a crossfunctional design experience.

- Utilize local browser TTS to "speak through" prompts and utterances
- Utilize code snippets to pre-sketch logic components for developers
- Store complex or repeated processes in [subflows](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/editor/workspace/subflows)
- Include http calls and responses
  - To query live NLU models within your design
  - To query information/text services
  - Other external services relevant to design
- Export flow to a machine-readable graph JSON 
  - JSON can be postprocessed to calculate and list all possible flow paths
  - Statistics on longest and shortest path combinations
