Meta4 is a team communication and ideation tool. It helps you to reflect together on previous work, or identify risks and opportunities in upcoming tasks.

## How does it work?
### Make
Download the pdf by clicking the above image. Then print on cardstock, or use regular paper and glue to colorful construction paper.

### Reflect
The dealer draws or chooses five cards from the deck to reflect upon one-by-one. Team members write feedback on sticky notes for either the positive metaphor, the negative one, or both.

### Prioritize
After recording feedback stickies for each card, each team member selects their top three and puts them on the board.
### Cluster
Once the stickies are on the board, then can be clustered as a team into topic groups.

### Vote
Vote on the clusters to identify the most important action points or experiences to remember for the future.

### Act
Optimize your workflow by putting the team's feedback into effect.
