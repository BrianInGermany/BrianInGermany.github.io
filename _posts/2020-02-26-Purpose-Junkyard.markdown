# Why have a personal website?
- to keep track of useful technology I discover in my projects
- to provide an index of all the projects I am working on or have worked on and want to share.
- maybe even to show off a little :D


{% highlight python %}
def hello_world():
    print("Hello World!")
{% endhighlight %}
