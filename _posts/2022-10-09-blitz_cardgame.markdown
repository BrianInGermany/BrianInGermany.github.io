Win by not losing! In this fun Blackjack-predecessor, keep your lives to stay afloat.

![](/assets/images/blitz.jpg)

Blitz is played with a 32-card deck, using only the sevens through aces.
- For added fun, you can use a [German-face deck](https://www.piatnik.com/spiele/spielkarten/regionale-karten/doppeldeutsche-blitz-36-blatt) as pictured above, but an ordinary pack of cards will work just as well.
- The game is played best with 3-7 players.  

## Setup
At the start of the game, each player is given three lives (matchsticks, coins, etc.).  
Each player is dealt three cards.
 - The dealer has the right to keep his cards or exchange them.
 - If the dealer wants to exchange his cards, he puts his original cards in the center of the table as the bank, and draws three new cards.
The player to the left of the dealer is first.

## Gameplay
The aim of Blitz is to gather three cards of the same suit for the highest score.
- Aces are worth 11, face cards 10, and all other cards are worth their number value.
- Each turn, players may exchange *one or all cards, but not two*.
- The round ends in one of three ways:
  1. A player reaches 31 points
  2. A player has three aces (blitz).
  3. A player closed the round 
     - Closing is denoted by knocking and is only possible after the first round of exchanging cards.
     - If you choose to close, you may not exchange cards, and the game ends after every other player has one more chance to play.

## End of Game
The player(s) with the lowest score loses one life. Once all a player's lives are gone, she is "swimming" on one final life, after which she loses.

## Additional Important Rules
If a player gets three aces, the game is immediately over, and every other player loses one life.
  - "Blitz!"
If you have three-of-a-kind, your hand is worth exactly 30.5 points.

## Conclusion
The earlier you can get a high score, the earlier you can "knock" to jump the gun on opponents that haven't had time to collect points.
