Win by not losing! In this fun Blackjack predecessor, keep your lives to stay afloat.

![](/assets/images/blitz.jpg)

Blitz is played with a 32-card deck, using only the sevens through aces.
- For added fun, you can use a [German-face deck](https://www.piatnik.com/spiele/spielkarten/regionale-karten/doppeldeutsche-blitz-36-blatt) as pictured above, but an ordinary pack of cards will work just as well.
- The game is played best with 3-7 players.  
- It's also known as 31 or Scat

## Setup
- At the start of the game, each player is given three lives (matchsticks, coins, etc.).  
- Each player is dealt three cards.
  - The dealer inspects her cards, and has the option to keep them or put them in the center and take three new cards.
    - If the dealer keeps her cards, three additional cards from the deck are placed in the center.
- The player to the left of the dealer is first to play.

## Gameplay
The aim of Blitz is to gather three cards of the same suit for the highest score.
- Aces are worth 11, face cards 10, and all other cards are worth their number value.
- Each turn, players may exchange *one or all cards, but not two*.
- The round ends in one of three ways:
  1. A player reaches 31 points
  2. A player has three aces (blitz).
  3. A player closes the round 
     - Closing is denoted by knocking and is only possible after the first round.
     - If you choose to close, you may not exchange cards, and the game ends after every other player has one more chance to play.

## End of Game
The player(s) with the lowest score loses one life. Once all a player's lives are gone, she is "swimming" on one final life, after which she loses.

## Additional Important Rules
- If a player gets three aces, the game is immediately over, and every other player loses one life.
  - "Blitz!"
- Three-of-a-kind is worth exactly 30.5 points.
- You can always pass instead of exchanging cards or closing.

## Strategy Tips
- The earlier you can get a high score, the earlier you can "knock" to jump the gun on opponents that haven't had time to collect points.
- Make sure you don't accidentally create a good hand in the bank by exchanging cards.
  - Remember, the next player can take all three cards!
