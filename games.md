1. I'm a fan of brief games you can still hold a conversation over.
2. I like simple games that you don't have to be an expert for.
3. And I prefer games that aren't pinned to one language.  
   
# Traditional Games

- [66](https://thejunkyard.cc/2022/10/09/sixty-six_cardgame.html)
  - Use memory and strategy to make tricks and reach 66 before your opponent!

- [Blitz](https://thejunkyard.cc/2022/10/09/blitz_cardgame.html)
  - Win by not losing! In this fun Blackjack predecessor, keep your lives to stay afloat.

- Durak
  - Gang up on (defenseless? :) ) opponents in this souped-up version of war for 3-8 players.
- Scopa!  
  - In this traditional Italian two-player, use your numbered cards in the suits coins, sticks, swords and cups to match as many cards on the board as possible. If you sweep them all away: "Scopa!" (means broom), you get an extra point.

# Modern Games
- Banana Bandido
  - Banana generators, stick stealers and baboon's butts: in this fast-paced card game, use any means necessary to collect the most bananas!

- Hive
  - Boardless boardgame for two players. Move your hexagonal insect pieces around the field to surround your opponent's queen bee and win the hive.

- Spicy
  - Lie your way to the top with these beautifully illustrated, Korean-style cards numbered 1-10 in the suits wasabi, chili, and pepper. Kind of like the American game "BS", but more fancy. :)
- Wizard
  - This trick-making game is more about guessing how many tricks your hand can make than actually making the tricks themselves. It's basically a 52-card deck plus four wizards and four jokers.
- Pick-omino/Heckmeck
  - 2-7-player dice-rolling game where you have to match the rolled numbers with numbered domino-like pieces on the table. Weird worm-and-chicken based theme, but if it's fun, who cares?
