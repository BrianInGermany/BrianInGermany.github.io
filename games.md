# Brian's Game Reviews

- [Blitz](https://thejunkyard.cc/2022/10/09/blitz_cardgame.html)
  - Win by not losing! In this fun Blackjack predecessor, keep your lives to stay afloat.  
- Durak
  - Gang up on (defenseless? :) ) opponents in this souped-up version of war for 3-8 players.
- Banana Bandido
  - Banana generators, stick stealers and baboon's butts: in this fast-paced card game, use any means necessary to collect the most bananas!
- Hive
  - Boardless boardgame for two players. Move your insects around the field to surround your opponent's queen bee and win the hive.
