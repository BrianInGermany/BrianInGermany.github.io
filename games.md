Last year I joined my first tabletop games meetup in Offenbach, Germany.

I got hooked on a rowdy German card game called [Banana Bandido](https://thejunkyard.cc/games/#:~:text=Modern%20Games-,Banana%20Bandido,-Banana%20generators%2C%20stick), and proceeded expanding my collection little by little :)

Before I joined the meetup, the world of gaming seemed rule-heavy and impenetrable to my only casual interest. But I've been having fun discovering games that liven up a get-together and make it easy to join in, instead of erecting a wall of rules...

Have a look, and if you have any suggestions for new games, please comment!

| [Banana Bandido](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/290462/banana-bandido) | 2-5 :boy:| fast pace   | Banana generators, stick stealers and baboon's butts: in this fast-paced card game, use any means necessary to collect the most bananas!                                                                                                 | <img src="/assets/images/bananabandido.jpg"  alt="bananabandido">   |
| [Durak](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/29351/durak)                    | 4-8 :boy:| fast pace   | Gang up on (defenseless? :) ) opponents in this souped-up version of war for 4-8 players.                                                                                                                                                |                                                                     |
| [Spicy](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/299169/spicy)                   | 2-6 :boy:| fast pace   | Lie your way to the top with these beautifully illustrated, Korean-style cards numbered 1-10 in the suits wasabi, chili, and pepper. Kind of like the American game "BS", but spiffier.                                                  |                                                                     |
| [President](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6748/scum-food-chain-game)  | 4-10 :boy:| fast pace   | Shed cards as fast as possible by winning tricks with single cards or multiples-of-a-kind. 2's are high and the winner gets a fancy title :)                                                                                             |                                                                     |
| [Scopa!](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15889/scopa)                   | 2 :boy:| fast pace   | In this traditional Italian two-player, use your numbered cards in the suits coins, sticks, swords and cups to match as many cards on the board as possible. If you sweep them all away: "Scopa!" (means broom), you get an extra point. | <img src="/assets/images/scopa.jpg" alt="scopa">                    |
| [66](https://thejunkyard.cc/2022/10/09/sixty-six_cardgame.html) :heart:      | 2 :boy:| medium pace | In this classic card game, use memory and strategy to make tricks and reach 66 before your opponent!                                                                                                                                                                | <img src="/assets/images/66.jpg"  alt="66">                         |
| [Pick-omino/Heckmeck](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15818/pickomino)  | 2-7 :boy:| medium pace | Dice-rolling game where you have to match the rolled numbers with numbered domino-like pieces on the table. Weird worm-and-chicken based theme, but if it's fun, who cares?                                                              | <img src="/assets/images/heckmeck.jpg" alt="heckmeck">              |
| [Oh Hell!](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1116/oh-hell)                   | 3-7 :boy:| medium pace | This trick-making game is more about guessing how many tricks your hand can make than actually making the tricks themselves. Hands change incrementally in size throughout rounds.                    |                                                                     |
| [Blitz](https://thejunkyard.cc/2022/10/09/blitz_cardgame.html)  :heart:      | 2-7 :boy:| relaxed pace   | Win by not losing! In this fun Blackjack predecessor, keep your lives to stay afloat.                                                                                                                                                    | <img src="/assets/images/blitz.jpg" alt="blitz">                    |
| [Hive](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2655/hive)                       | 2 :boy:| relaxed pace   | Boardless boardgame for two players. Move your hexagonal insect pieces around the field to surround your opponent's queen bee and win the hive.                                                                                          | <img src="/assets/images/hive.jpg" alt="hive">                      |
